<h1> "Drama: An Outlet For expression and  enhancing creativity"</h1>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p1>It's never too early to encourage a child's artistic endeavours. All children learn better when they play imaginatively, especially in their early years. Imaginary scenarious, acting out concepts, and role-playing assist young children in making sense of the world around them (AGDE, 2022). At child care we should promote theatrical theatre among the youngest students which makes the children more focused towards learning (AGDE, 2022). Creative theatre is a vital part of our early childhood education program because it gives childs the framework and encouragement they need to use their experiences to expand on what they already know.
