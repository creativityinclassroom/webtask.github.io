<img class="img_eg" src="slp.jpg">
<h2> Introduction and Importance of Movement and Music in Early Childhood Curriculum </h2>
<p1>
Movement and music are fundamental components of early childhood education, providing children with opportunities to explore, express themselves and develop creativity. These activities are not only enjoyable but also essential for physical development, coordination, rhythm and spatial awareness. Movement activities enhance motor skills, balance and body control, while music fosters memory, and emotional expression. When combined, movement and music create a rich, multisensory learning environment that nurtures creativity, cognitive growth, and social interaction.Similarly, there is no downside to bringing children and music together through fun activities.(Bright Horizons, February 25, 2022)
